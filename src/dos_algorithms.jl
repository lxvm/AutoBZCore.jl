Generalized Gilat-Raubenheimer method as in ["Generalized Gilatâ€“Raubenheimer method for
density-of-states calculation in photonic
crystals"](https://doi.org/10.1088/2040-8986/aaae52).
This method requires the Hamiltonian and its derivatives, and performs a linear
extrapolation at each k-point in an equispace grid. The algorithm is expected to show
second-order convergence and suffer reduced error at band crossings compared to
interpolatory methods.

## Arguments
- `npt`: the number of k-points per dimension

Compute a density of states extrapolation by smearing the Dirac distribution
with a rational kernel of order `m`, as presented in ["Computing Spectral
Measures of Self-Adjoint operators"](https://doi.org/10.1137/20M1330944).
This algorithm requires `using Richardson`.

This algorithm assumes that the operator `H` is a function of a continuous
crystal momentum, `H(k)`, and will use the integration algorithm `alg` to
estimate that integral. Additionally, the parameter `p` passed to `DOSProblem`
should be the domain of integration (e.g. the Brillouin zone). Finally, the
other `kwargs` passed to `RationalRichardson` will be used as the integration
solver keywords, such as `abstol`, `reltol`, and `maxiters`, which the caller
should set.

The parameters `h>0` and `power` control the initial evaluation point and the
exponent of the expansion in `h`, respectively. See
[Richardson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMath/Richardson.jl) for more details on
these keywords as well as `contract` and `breaktol`.
